# 2.4 GHz Jammer — Real‑World Study (Educational Purpose Only)

**Author:** Nafiz Sadik  
**Purpose:** Study and document a **real‑world 2.4 GHz jammer concept** for teaching, analysis, and research. **This repository is strictly for educational purposes only.** It intentionally omits any operational, hardware hookup, transmitter code, amplifier settings, or step‑by‑step instructions that would enable building, operating, or deploying a real jamming device.

## IMPORTANT — READ BEFORE USING

This project studies **real‑world concepts** related to 2.4 GHz interference devices for educational, analytical, and safety research. **However, this repository does NOT contain any actionable material to construct or operate a jammer.** No wiring diagrams, no transmit code, no amplifier/PA settings, and no test or deployment procedures are included.

**Why this matters:** Real jammers and high‑power RF equipment can:
- disrupt critical public safety communications (police, ambulance, aviation),  
- produce harmful RF exposure, and  
- cause severe legal penalties (fines, device confiscation, or criminal charges).

If you need to test or demonstrate real RF transmission for legitimate, supervised research, ALWAYS:
1. Obtain written permission from your institution and the local communications regulator.  
2. Use accredited test facilities (Faraday cage / RF shielded room / licensed test range).  
3. Follow institutional safety protocols and maintain responsible oversight.

## What this repository contains (safe, non‑operational)
- Firmware UI / menu demo (`firmware/ui_menu.ino`) — **sanitized**: menu shows real‑world topics but all dangerous functions are replaced by safe placeholders. No transmit/jamming routines are included.
- Documentation: real‑world theory, analysis approach, risk assessment, legal/ethical notes (`docs/`).
- Offline simulations and signal analysis scripts (e.g., spectrograms) that model signals without any RF transmission (`simulations/`).
