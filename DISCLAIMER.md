This repository studies real‑world jammer concepts strictly for education, analysis, and safety research. It does NOT include:
- hardware wiring diagrams for transmitters or jammers,
- transmit or jamming code,
- amplifier/PA or antenna tuning instructions,
- step‑by‑step instructions for building or operating interference devices.

Do NOT attempt to construct, operate, or test any device intended to interfere with radio communications. Doing so is illegal in most countries and can endanger life and property.

If you require real transmission testing for legitimate research:
- obtain written approval from your institution and regulator, and
- use accredited RF test facilities (Faraday cages / shielded labs) under supervision.
